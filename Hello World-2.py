###Introduction to Python programming

# Variables and Multiple Assignment

#Variables are useful for holding information. They are like boxes that store data.
#You can assign multiple variables at once using multiple assignment.
#You can also assign multiple variables to the same value by chaining assignments.

# Arithmetic Operators and Strings

#There are four arithmetic operators in Python:

#+ for addition
#- for subtraction
#* for multiplication
#/ for division

# Arithmetic operators:
# + - * / %

age1 = 12
age2 = 18

print(age1 + age2)
print(age1 * age2)
print(age1 / age2)
print(age1 % age2)                              #modulus provides the remainder of the operation
print(age2 % age1)

first_name = "Dami"
last_name = "Ajib"
print(first_name + last_name)                   # without space
print(first_name + " " + last_name)             # without space

###

print("hi" * 10)                                #printing a string multiple times

###

sent = "Dami was playing basketball"             #each character has an index (starting from 0)
print(sent[0])                                   #to get the first character
print(sent[0:4])                                 #Slicing is used to get a range of characters




# Placeholders in Strings

#There are three ways to substitute data into strings in Python:
#Concatenation uses the + operator to combine strings.
#Placeholders use the % operator to insert values into strings.
#Formatted strings use the f prefix to insert values into strings.

#e.g. to design an automated email system that sends out personalized messages to each recipient.
#you can create a generic messagee with placeholder for names and other specific details and python 
#would fill each with the appropriate data.
#placeholders are markers that stands in for some value.

###Task 1
#1. Write a script that adds 15 and 30 and divides the sum by 2. Print out the answer.
a = 15
b = 30

print ((a + b) /2)

#2. Initialize two variables and use arithmetic operators to add, subtract, multiply, divide, and find the remainder.

# Introduction to Lists

#Use lists to store ordered sets of items. Lists are mutable, meaning you can change the items in a list after you create it.
#Lists are created using square brackets [].
#Items in a list are separated by commas ,.
#Lists can contain any type of data, including other lists.


#A list is a set of ordered items that have an index and you know the order based on the index
#e.g a shopping list
item1 = 'apples'
item2 = 'oranges'
item3 = 'bananas'
item4 = 'cheese'
#instead of creating lists of variables which is inefficient, create a list
###

shopping_list = ['apples', 'oranges', 'bananas', 'cheese']              #creating a list
print(shopping_list)
print(shopping_list[0])                                                 #index 0 is the first item
print(shopping_list[2])
print(shopping_list[0:2])                                               #Slicing doesnt count the end range
print(shopping_list[0:3])

###
#append: help to add to an existing list
shopping_list.append('blueberries') # add items
print(shopping_list)                                                    #to check
###
#to change/replace an item in a list
shopping_list[0] = 'cherries' # update items
print(shopping_list)

###
#del: to delete an item from a list
del shopping_list[1] # delete items
print(shopping_list)

###

print(len(shopping_list)) # length of list i.e. gives the number of items in a list

###

shopping_list2 = ['bread', 'jam', 'pb']
print(shopping_list + shopping_list2)                               #to add lists together
print(shopping_list * 2)                                            #you can repeat lists

###

list_num = [1,4,7,23,6]
print(max(list_num))                                        #maximum
print(min(list_num))                                        #minimum




# Welcome to Dictionaries!

#Dictionaries in Python are a collection of key-value pairs. They are unordered, changeable, and indexed.
#Dictionaries are written with curly brackets {}
#Have keys and values separated by a colon :.
#Each key-value pair is separated by a comma ,.

students = ['bob', 12, 'rachel', 13, 'emily', 15]
print(students)
#instead of using list which is efficient, create dictionaries.
#e.g a class of students with unique name and age. to find a students e.g age without locating the name
###

students = {'bob': 12, 'rachel': 13, 'emily': 15}           #creating a dictionary with the student name as KEY and the age as VALUE
print(students)
print(students['rachel'])
print(students['bob'])

###

students['rachel'] = 14                                     #to update an existing data in a library E.g rachel tuurns 14
print(students)

### 

del students['emily']                                       #to delete data, e.g emiily leaves thhe school
print(students)

###

print(len(students))

###

students = {'bob': 12, 'bob': 13, 'bob': 15}                #NB: keep key unique since python doesnt know which e.g. bob you need  
print(students)




# Introduction to Tuples

#Tuples are similar to lists, are sequential, but they are immutable. 
# This means that once you create a tuple, you cannot add, remove or change elements. 
#Tuples are created using parentheses ().
#Items in a tuple are separated by commas ,.
#Tuples are useful for consistency, safety

tup = ('oranges', 'apples', 'bananas')
print(tup)
# tup[0] = 'cherries'                                       #this returns an error messageUncomment to see error.
print(tup[0:2])                                             #Slicing is possible in tupples

###

tup2 = (12, 14) 
tup3 = tup + tup2                                           #concatenation is possible with another tuple

# Conditional Statements

#Conditional statements are used to execute code based on certain conditions. 
# it operates on if (a condition is met) -else(alternative if condition is not met) principle.
#indentation by 1 tabspace is important.
#In Python, we have the following conditional statements:
#if statement
#elif statement
#else statement

# Introduction to FOR Loops

#For loops allow us to run a piece of code repeatedly.
#For loops are created using the for ... in syntax.
#We can use for loops to iterate over a sequence of items, such as a list or a tuple.
#We can use the range() function to generate a sequence of numbers.

#For loop: is good for iterating over data structures or navigating through a data structure 
#and performing operations on each items e.g printing, modifying, or extracting information.

# Introduction to While Loops

#While loops allow us to run a piece of code repeatedly, i.e it keeps executing, as long as the conditions are true.
#While loops are created using the while keyword.
#Runs repeatedly as long as a condition is True.

#while loops and control statements: e.g a home automation system that needs to regulate heating based on the room's temperature

# Welcome to Functions!

#So far we have used functions. We can also define our own functions.

#Define functions using the def keyword.
#Functions can take arguments.
#Functions can return values.

#functions promote code-reuse and thereby enhacing the efficiency and compactness of a code
#e.g a baker that follows a specific set of steps in making a particular bread
#so this means you can create a function with the set of steps, so you just 
#call the function instead of writing the steps everytime you want to make the bread.
def hello_world():                                      #in this case the () is empty because there is no need for any input parameters
  print("Hello World")                                  #no output because the function is defined but not explicitly called
  
hello_world()                                           #here, there is an output when the function is invoked

###

#e.g. a function that takes a username as input and greets them

def greeting(name):
  print("Hi " + name + "!")

greeting("Dami")

###

def add(num1, num2):                                    #e.g. a function that adds two numbers and prints their sum
  print(num1 + num2)

add(10, 15)

###
# return statement to save the output or result of the function instead of printing it

def add(num1, num2):
  return num1 + num2                                   #return passes back the result of the computation and we can then save the result to a new variable

# Built-in Python Functions

#Python has many built-in functions that we can use.

#abs() - Return the absolute value of a number.
#dir() - Return a list of attributes and methods of an object.
#help() - Get help on a function.
#bool() - Convert a value to a boolean.
#int() - Convert a value to an integer.
#float() - Convert a value to a float.
#str() - Convert a value to a string.

###Task: Factorial Generator: Calculate the Factorial of a Number

#Instructions:

#1. Define a function called `calculate_factorial` that takes in one parameter, `number`.
#2. Inside the function, write code to calculate the factorial of the given number.
#3. The factorial of a number is the product of all positive integers less than or equal to that number. For example, the factorial of 5 is 5 * 4 * 3 * 2 * 1 = 120.
#4. You can use either loops or recursion to calculate the factorial.
#5. Return the factorial as the output of the function.

#solution: iterative approach (preferably for large n)
#The function factorial_iterative initializes a result variable to 1.
#It then multiplies this result by each integer from 1 up to n.
#The final result is returned as the factorial of the number.
def calculate_factorial(n):
    if n < 0:
        raise ValueError("Factorial is not defined for negative numbers")
    result = 1
    for i in range(1, n + 1):
        result *= i
    return result

print(calculate_factorial(5))

#solution: recursive approach
#The function factorial_recursive checks if n is 0 or 1. If so, it returns 1 because the factorial of 0 and 1 is 1.
#For any other positive number, it returns n multiplied by the factorial of n-1, thus breaking the problem into smaller subproblems.
def calculate_factorial(n):
    if n < 0:
        raise ValueError("Factorial is not defined for negative numbers")
    if n == 0 or n == 1:
        return 1
    return n * calculate_factorial(n - 1)

print(calculate_factorial(5))



#object oriented programming
# OOP - Classes and Objects

#The object-oriented programming (OOP) paradigm is based on the concept of "objects".
#Objects are instances of classes, which are templates for creating objects.
#Classes define the properties and behaviors of objects.

#Dammy think:
#class: Dog (the class defines what a dog is) 
#property: the properties of the class includes: name, breed, age, behaviours 
#methods: behaviours are methods in programming terms: bark, eat, sleep 
#but the class is just a concept and it doesn't bark or sleep, meaning it merely describes what a dog is or can do 
#Object: is an instance of a class e.g. Fido and Buddy have the properties of a dog like name, and behaviour like bark eat and sleep
#however Fido and Buddy are distinct entities with different properties:
#e.g Fido, 3yr, german shepherd; Buddy, 5yr, golden retriever


#first of all, real world modeling classes and objects help model real world concepts into code, making it easier to understand and work with.
#Second, reusability. Once you've made a dog class, you can create as many dog objects as you need, saving you the effort of defining dogs again and again.
#last, organization. It helps you organize and structure your code better by creating a class dog.
#you can use it to create any number of dog objects, each with its own set of attributes and behaviors.

#This is the essence of object oriented programming. It allows you to create structured, reusable, and intuitive code.

        #First, let's think of a class as a blueprint or a plan. Example: a person.
        #This person blueprint is our class, and it can contain some basic information that every person has,like a name and an age.
        #But right now it's just a blueprint. It's not a specific person, just a general idea of what a person is.


class Person:                                                       #to define a class/blueprint
  pass

p = Person()                                                       #p is object #to create a specific person /an instance of the person:class/person:object
print(p)

class Person:                                                       
  def __init__(self, name, age):               #--init--: to define attributes when creating a new person:object
    self.name = name                           #self keyword is a reference to the current instance of the class and it is used to access its attributes
    self.age = age                             #name and age are the parameters passed in to define what the objects name and age would be 
  
  def getName(self):                           #methods: are functions defined inside a class that performs actions related to the object of the class
    return self.name                           
  
  def getAge(self):
    return self.age

p1 = Person("Bob", 22)                         #Bob and 22 are the attributes of the P1 object
print(p1)
print(p1.getName())                            #to find out the name and age of P1, we simply call these methods on the p1 object
print(p1.getAge())

#object oriented programming in Python is all about creating classes, which are blueprints and objects which are instances of these blueprints.
#It allows us to structure our code in a way that is easy to understand and reuse, mirroring how we categorize and think about the world around us.




# OOP - Class Inheritance

#Inheritance is a powerful feature of object-oriented programming (OOP) that allows us to create new classes based on existing classes.
#The new class is called a "subclass" or "child class".
#The existing class is called a "superclass" or "parent class".


#Dammy think:
#Imagine a car manufacturing company. They make a base model car with common features like an engine, wheels, seats, and so on.
#Now they also produce variations of this base model, such as a sports version with a more powerful engine, or a luxury version with high end seats.
#These variations inherit the common features from the base model, but also add or modify some features.
#That's exactly how inheritance works in programming for classes two.

class Car:                                                      #to create a base class.   
  def __init__(self):                                           #to define attributes of the base class object
    self.wheels = 4
    self.seats = 5
   
  def drive(self):                                              #method: drive
    print("Driving a car...")
    
myCar = Car()                                                   #to define an instance of car
myCar.drive()

#to create a sporty car class that inherits from the car class
#the sporty car class would have a more powerful engine and fewer seats
class SportsCar(Car):                                           #in parenthesis is the class you are inheriting from i.e.the car class
  def __init__(self):
    super().__init__()                                          #super: to execute the --init-- method of the parent car class, ensuring we don't lose the attributes initialized there.
    self.engine_power = '400 HP'                                #the sportcar class adds a new attribute called the engine power
    self.seats = 2                                              #the sportcar class modifies the seats attribute
    
  def drive(self):
    print("Driving a sports car...")                            #method: reinitializing the drive function to read...driving a sport car
    
mySportsCar = SportsCar()                                       #to create sport car object
mySportsCar.drive()                                             #to call the sport car method

###

#NB: result If we didn't specify the drive method in sports car
class SportsCar(Car):
  def __init__(self):
    super().__init__()
    self.engine_power = '400 HP'
    self.seats = 2
    
mySportsCar = SportsCar()
mySportsCar.drive()

#three key reasons why class inheritance is important
#1. reusability of code. In our car example, we didn't have to rewrite the attributes for wheels and seats for the sports car. We could inherit them from the car class. 
#2. This also allows for easy maintenance and updates. If we wanted to change a common feature across all car types, we just need to change it in the car class and the subclasses will inherit the changes.
#3. organized structure.It makes logical sense to have a base car class and then subclasses for different types of cars. It makes our code easier to understand and manage.
